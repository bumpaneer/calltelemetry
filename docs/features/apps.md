# Apps
[Latest App Catalog](https://www.calltelemetry.com/features/apps)  
Apps are a modular services that can trigger on any rule event. 

## What can apps do?
### Alerts
You can receive "alert" via Webex Teams, Email, Twilio, and more.

### Modifying call flow
No apps do this today, but in the future, some apps will perform native actions - like blocking or redirecting a call. For example, to authenticate the caller, the service might redirect the call to an IVR to enter a code, then on the second time hitting the App let the caller through the system.
